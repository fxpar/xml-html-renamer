# xml-html-renamer

Very simple script to loop around some xml or html fragment and modify the elements.

It took me a while to succeed, mainly because the renameNode method from dom3 core has not been implemented by browsers and the javascript community. Only within JAVA have I found it. 

You will find here

 1. a single html page 
 1. the java version
 1. the electron app version
